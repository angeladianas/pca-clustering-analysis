# pca-clustering-analysis

This project is divided into two parts. The first part attempted to conduct a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on HBATred dataset. The dataset is a web-survey result that was conducted among 100 companies’ customers. It contains information about 10 variables, each on a scale from 0-10, with 10 being “excellent” and 0 being “poor”. One extracted 80 observations randomly and performed a Principal Component Analysis. 
The second part utilized Store dataset to perform a cluster analysis. The dataset is a survey of purchasing behaviour of 275 women which comprises of 18 questions about their attitudes regarding choice of clothing store, each on a scale from 1 to 5 with 1 being “Not at all important” and 5 being “Very important”. One extracted 200 observations randomly and attempted to create clusters to define typical customers in a clothing store for women.
